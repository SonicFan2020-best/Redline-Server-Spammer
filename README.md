# Redline Server Spammer (CLEAN EDITION!) By SonicFan2020-best

Spamming randomized nonsense data against Redline stealers' C&amp;C servers.  

## Brief intro
I encountered a Redline password stealer sample that was being distributed by malicious entities using seemingly compromised Discord accounts.

This script spams randomly generated not offensive data to the C&C server of the malware sample described above.  
  
## WARNING(1): Do NOT use/modify this tool against innocent websites.
I uploaded the script just for ppls to spam malicious sites only, in effort of taking those scumbags down or at least rendering their service unavailable.
  
## Warning #2 has been removed.
Why? It is because in this version, if you want to avoid cyberbullying a scammer but instead just annoy them and ruin their day. I have replaced the message with messages that keep bugging them to take down the file. 

  
## Usage
`node /path/to/directory/of/package`  
  
You should run this script ONLY under sandboxed environments with proper VPN settings. Node.js >= 11.7.0 is required.
